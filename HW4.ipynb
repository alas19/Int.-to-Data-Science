       " 'On the edge of theriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all theprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was thebeacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon apole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, withsome chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate.',\n",
       " 'The man waslimping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,and come down, and going back to hook himself up again.',\n",

       " 'Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, andhaving confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the momentI raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,sitting in the chimney corner.',\n",

       " 'And she’sout now, making it a baker’s dozen.”“Is she?”“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with her.”At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoatround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire.',\n",
       " 'Ticklerwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickledframe.',\n",
       " '“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab atTickler, and she Ram-paged out.',\n",
       " 'That’s what she did,” said Joe, slowlyclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking atit; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger speciesof child, and as no more than my equal.',\n",
       " '“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she’s been on theRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip.',\n",

       " 'Getbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”I took the advice.',\n",
       " 'My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,and applied Tickler to its further investigation.',\n",
       " 'She concluded bythrowing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad toget hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietlyfenced me up there with his great leg.',\n",
       " '“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping herfoot.',\n",
       " '“Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear me away withfret and fright and worrit, or I’d have you out of that corner if youwas fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.”“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying andrubbing myself.',\n",
       " '“Churchyard!” repeated my sister.',\n",
       " '“If it warn’t for me you’d have beento the churchyard long ago, and stayed there.',\n",
       " 'Who brought you up byhand?”“You did,” said I.',\n",

       " 'I maytruly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.',\n",
       " 'It’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gargery) withoutbeing your mother.”My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately atthe fire.',\n",
       " 'For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, themysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I wasunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before mein the avenging coals.',\n",
       " '“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station.',\n",
       " '“Churchyard,indeed!',\n",
       " 'You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, by the by,had not said it at all.',\n",
       " '“You’ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixtyou, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you’d be withoutme!”As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at meover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, andcalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under thegrievous circumstances foreshadowed.',\n",
       " 'After that, he sat feeling hisright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about withhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.',\n",
       " 'My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,that never varied.',\n",
       " 'First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hardand fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, andsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths.',\n",
       " 'Then shetook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—usingboth sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming andmoulding the butter off round the crust.',\n",
       " 'Then, she gave the knife afinal smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a verythick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from theloaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.',\n",
       " 'On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.',\n",
       " 'I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadfulacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man.',\n",
       " 'I knewMrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that mylarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.',\n",
       " 'Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg ofmy trousers.',\n",
       " 'The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose Ifound to be quite awful.',\n",
       " 'It was as if I had to make up my mind to leapfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.',\n",
       " 'And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe.',\n",
       " 'In ouralready-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in hisgood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to comparethe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to eachother’s admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.',\n",
       " 'To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fastdiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but hefound me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and myuntouched bread and butter on the other.',\n",
       " 'At last, I desperatelyconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it hadbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with thecircumstances.',\n",
       " 'I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked atme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.',\n",
       " 'Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my lossof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which hedidn’t seem to enjoy.',\n",
       " 'He turned it about in his mouth much longer thanusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down likea pill.',\n",
       " 'He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head onone side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he sawthat my bread and butter was gone.',\n",
       " 'The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold ofhis bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister’sobservation.',\n",
       " '“What’s the matter _now_?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.',\n",
       " '“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very seriousremonstrance.',\n",
       " '“Pip, old chap!',\n",
       " 'You’ll do yourself a mischief.',\n",
       " 'It’llstick somewhere.',\n",
       " 'You can’t have chawed it, Pip.”“What’s the matter now?” repeated my sister, more sharply than before.',\n",
       " '“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to doit,” said Joe, all aghast.',\n",
       " '“Manners is manners, but still your elth’syour elth.”By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a littlewhile against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, lookingguiltily on.',\n",
       " '“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister, out ofbreath, “you staring great stuck pig.”Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, andlooked at me again.',\n",
       " '“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,“you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you,any time.',\n",
       " 'But such a—” he moved his chair and looked about the floorbetween us, and then again at me—“such a most oncommon Bolt as that!”“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister.',\n",
       " '“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was yourage—frequent—and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I neversee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you ain’t Bolteddead.”My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, sayingnothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a finemedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness.',\n",
       " 'At thebest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as achoice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling likea new fence.',\n",
       " 'On this particular evening the urgency of my case demandeda pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greatercomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would beheld in a bootjack.',\n",
       " 'Joe got off with half a pint; but was made toswallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching andmeditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging frommyself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had hadnone before.',\n",
       " 'Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, inthe case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secretburden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a greatpunishment.',\n",
       " 'The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—Inever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of thehousekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keepingone hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered aboutthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind.',\n",
       " 'Then,as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard thevoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me tosecrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve untilto-morrow, but must be fed now.',\n",
       " 'At other times, I thought, What if theyoung man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing hishands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or shouldmistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart andliver to-night, instead of to-morrow!',\n",
       " 'If ever anybody’s hair stood onend with terror, mine must have done so then.',\n",
       " 'But, perhaps, nobody’sever did?',\n",
       " 'It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, witha copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock.',\n",

       " 'But she answered at last, andher light came along the dark passage like a star.',\n",
       " 'Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from thetable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against herpretty brown hair.',\n",
       " '“Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use itwell.',\n",
       " 'Let me see you play cards with this boy.”“With this boy?',\n",
       " 'Why, he is a common labouring-boy!”I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,—only it seemed sounlikely,—“Well?',\n",
       " 'You can break his heart.”“What do you play, boy?” asked Estella of myself, with the greatestdisdain.',\n",
       " '“Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.”“Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella.',\n",
       " 'So we sat down to cards.',\n",

       " 'I noticed thatMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she hadtaken it up.',\n",
       " 'As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at thedressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, nowyellow, had never been worn.',\n",
       " 'I glanced down at the foot from which theshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, nowyellow, had been trodden ragged.',\n",
       " 'Without this arrest of everything,this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even thewithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so likegrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.',\n",
       " 'So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings andtrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper.',\n",
       " 'I knewnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodiesburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of beingdistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must havelooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would havestruck her to dust.',\n",
       " '“He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,before our first game was out.',\n",
       " '“And what coarse hands he has!',\n",
       " 'And whatthick boots!”I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began toconsider them a very indifferent pair.',\n",
       " 'Her contempt for me was sostrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.',\n",
       " 'She won the game, and I dealt.',\n",
       " 'I misdealt, as was only natural, when Iknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me fora stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.',\n",
       " '“You say nothing of her,” remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she lookedon.',\n",
       " '“She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her.',\n",
       " 'Whatdo you think of her?”“I don’t like to say,” I stammered.',\n",
       " '“Tell me in my ear,” said Miss Havisham, bending down.',\n",
       " '“I think she is very proud,” I replied, in a whisper.',\n",
       " '“Anything else?”“I think she is very pretty.”“Anything else?”“I think she is very insulting.” (She was looking at me then with alook of supreme aversion.)',\n",
       " '“Anything else?”“I think I should like to go home.”“And never see her again, though she is so pretty?”“I am not sure that I shouldn’t like to see her again, but I shouldlike to go home now.”“You shall go soon,” said Miss Havisham, aloud.',\n",
       " '“Play the game out.”Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost surethat Miss Havisham’s face could not smile.',\n",
       " 'It had dropped into awatchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things abouther had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever liftit up again.',\n",
       " 'Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voicehad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.',\n",
       " 'I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me.',\n",
       " 'Shethrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if shedespised them for having been won of me.',\n",

       " 'Let him have something to eat, and let himroam and look about him while he eats.',\n",
       " 'Go, Pip.”I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and shestood it in the place where we had found it.',\n",
       " 'Until she opened the sideentrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it mustnecessarily be night-time.',\n",
       " 'The rush of the daylight quite confoundedme, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strangeroom many hours.',\n",
       " '“You are to wait here, you boy,” said Estella; and disappeared andclosed the door.',\n",
       " 'I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at mycoarse hands and my common boots.',\n",
       " 'My opinion of those accessories wasnot favourable.',\n",
       " 'They had never troubled me before, but they troubled menow, as vulgar appendages.',\n",
       " 'I determined to ask Joe why he had evertaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be calledknaves.',\n",
       " 'I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, andthen I should have been so too.',\n",
       " 'She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer.',\n",
       " 'Sheput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread andmeat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog indisgrace.',\n",
       " 'I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,—Icannot hit upon the right name for the smart—God knows what its namewas,—that tears started to my eyes.',\n",
       " 'The moment they sprang there, thegirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause ofthem.',\n",
       " 'This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, shegave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having madetoo sure that I was so wounded—and left me.',\n",
       " 'But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my facein, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned mysleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.',\n",
       " 'As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; sobitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,that needed counteraction.',\n",
       " 'My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive.',\n",
       " 'In the little world inwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there isnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice.',\n",
       " 'It may beonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child issmall, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as manyhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter.',\n",
       " 'Withinmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict withinjustice.',\n",
       " 'I had known, from the time when I could speak, that mysister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me.',\n",
       " 'I hadcherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gaveher no right to bring me up by jerks.',\n",
       " 'Through all my punishments,disgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I hadnursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in asolitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I wasmorally timid and very sensitive.',\n",
       " 'I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into thebrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed myface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate.',\n",
       " 'The bread and meatwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soonin spirits to look about me.',\n",
       " 'To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in thebrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some highwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if therehad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it.',\n",
       " 'But there were nopigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,no malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copperor the vat.',\n",
       " 'All the uses and scents of the brewery might haveevaporated with its last reek of smoke.',\n",
       " 'In a by-yard, there was awilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance ofbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted asa sample of the beer that was gone,—and in this respect I rememberthose recluses as being like most others.',\n",
       " 'Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an oldwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enoughto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of thehouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there wasa track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimeswalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then.',\n",
       " 'Butshe seemed to be everywhere.',\n",
       " 'For when I yielded to the temptationpresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walkingon them at the end of the yard of casks.',\n",
       " 'She had her back towards me,and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and neverlooked round, and passed out of my view directly.',\n",
       " 'So, in the breweryitself,—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they usedto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were.',\n",
       " 'When Ifirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near thedoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, andascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,as if she were going out into the sky.',\n",
       " 'It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happenedto my fancy.',\n",
       " 'I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it astranger thing long afterwards.',\n",
       " 'I turned my eyes—a little dimmed bylooking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a lownook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figurehanging there by the neck.',\n",
       " 'A figure all in yellow white, with but oneshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the fadedtrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face wasMiss Havisham’s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as ifshe were trying to call to me.',\n",
       " 'In the terror of seeing the figure, andin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a momentbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it.',\n",
       " 'And my terrorwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.',\n",
       " 'Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight ofpeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the revivinginfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would havebrought me round.',\n",
       " 'Even with those aids, I might not have come to myselfas soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, tolet me out.',\n",
       " 'She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, Ithought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.',\n",
       " 'She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced thatmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened thegate, and stood holding it.',\n",
       " 'I was passing out without looking at her,when she touched me with a taunting hand.',\n",
       " '“Why don’t you cry?”“Because I don’t want to.”“You do,” said she.',\n",
       " '“You have been crying till you are half blind, andyou are near crying again now.”She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.',\n",
       " 'I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook’s, and was immensely relieved tofind him not at home.',\n",
       " 'So, leaving word with the shopman on what day Iwas wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk toour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeplyrevolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit ofcalling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I hadconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-livedbad way.',\n",
       " 'Chapter IX.',\n",
       " 'When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about MissHavisham’s, and asked a number of questions.',\n",
       " 'And I soon found myselfgetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and thesmall of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against thekitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficientlength.',\n",
       " 'If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of otheryoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hiddenin mine,—which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason tosuspect myself of having been a monstrosity,—it is the key to manyreservations.',\n",
       " 'I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s asmy eyes had seen it, I should not be understood.',\n",
       " 'Not only that, but Ifelt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; andalthough she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained animpression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in mydragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) beforethe contemplation of Mrs. Joe.',\n",
       " 'Consequently, I said as little as Icould, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.',\n",
       " 'The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon bya devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, camegaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the detailsdivulged to him.',\n",
       " 'And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyesand mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoatheaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.',\n",
       " '“Well, boy,” Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in thechair of honour by the fire.',\n",
       " '“How did you get on up town?”I answered, “Pretty well, sir,” and my sister shook her fist at me.',\n",
       " '“Pretty well?” Mr. Pumblechook repeated.',\n",
       " '“Pretty well is no answer.',\n",
       " 'Tell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?”Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacyperhaps.',\n",
       " 'Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, myobstinacy was adamantine.',\n",
       " 'I reflected for some time, and then answeredas if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—Ihad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,—when Mr.Pumblechook interposed with “No!',\n",
       " 'Don’t lose your temper.',\n",
       " 'Leave this ladto me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.” Mr. Pumblechook then turned metowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,—“First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?”I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” andfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which wassomewhere about eightpence off.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Pumblechook then put me through mypence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pencemake three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if he haddone for me, “_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?” To which Ireplied, after a long interval of reflection, “I don’t know.” And I wasso aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, andsaid, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, forinstance?”“Yes!” said I.',\n",
       " 'And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it washighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, andbrought him to a dead stop.',\n",
       " '“Boy!',\n",
       " 'What like is Miss Havisham?” Mr. Pumblechook began again when hehad recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying thescrew.',\n",
       " '“Very tall and dark,” I told him.',\n",
       " '“Is she, uncle?” asked my sister.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that hehad never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.',\n",
       " '“Good!” said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly.',\n",
       " '(“This is the way to havehim!',\n",
       " 'We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always; youknow so well how to deal with him.”“Now, boy!',\n",
       " 'What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?” asked Mr.Pumblechook.',\n",
       " '“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another—as they wellmight—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”“Yes,” said I.',\n",
       " '“And Miss Estella—that’s her niece, I think—handed herin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate.',\n",
       " 'And we all hadcake and wine on gold plates.',\n",
       " 'And I got up behind the coach to eatmine, because she told me to.”“Was anybody else there?” asked Mr. Pumblechook.',\n",
